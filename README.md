**GRiD** is a Geospatial Management and Information System designed to warehouse and distribute both three-dimensional data, such as LiDAR data, as well as traditional two-dimensional geospatial data, such as imagery. For a data provider, GRiD offers data storage, support for multiple data formats, and _Oracle_-enabled secure user access control.  For a data user, GRiD provides an efficient web-based download mechanism, user-defined filters, and built-in terrain analysis algorithms.  By improving mechanisms for storage and sharing of three-dimensional datasets, GRiD is designed to increase the reach and impact of LiDAR technologies within and across networks, departments and disciplines.

**What is CRREL/Users?**  <a href="https://github.com/CRREL/Users/">CRREL/Users</a> is a <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> repository that is used to collect and curate content generated by GRiD users, including but not limited to user documentation, tutorials, and issues.

**Why GRiD?**  Adoption of aerial, vehicle-mounted, and terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies has accelerated in recent years across a wide range of disciplines, including engineering, architecture, agriculture, forestry, mining, archaeology, planetary science, defense, and civil security.   However, mechanisms have not kept pace for storing and sharing the pointclouds and related products that are associated with these very large datasets.  Current LIDAR data repositories typically are _ad hoc_ flat file storage systems not accessible outside the local network.  This structure limits distribution and discoverability of LIDAR data, does not enable efficient use of collection platforms, significantly increases network bandwidth requirements, and limits multiple collection product generation.  These limitations have significantly reduced the potential reach and impact of LiDAR technologies.  GRiD is designed to address these user needs. 

**Who are typical GRiD Users?**

* _Analysts_ search for, extract, and download data, and generate products for specific areas of interest.
* _Tasking professionals_ determine the availability of LiDAR data over an area of interest in order to plan collections.
* _System administrators_ perform system maintenance and upload LiDAR data.
* _Scientists and engineers_ identify opportunities for new data applications and for improvements in technology and processing.
* _Managers_ and other non-technical users access the system for informational purposes.

<p> The materials in CRREL/Users are designed to be accessible to non-technical users while providing practical and in-depth content sufficient for the majority of technically-oriented users.
